要挖掘这两类漏洞，首先要做的就是查看页面是否会被Cache。以下Headers中参数可用来确定该页面在服务器或用户终端是否会被Cache
1. X-Cache： in the response may have the value miss when the request wasn't cached and the value hit when it is cached
2. Cache-Control： indicates if a resource is being cached and when will be the next time the resource will be cached again: Cache-Control: public, max-age=1800
3. Vary： is often used in the response to indicate additional headers that are treated as part of the cache key even if they are normally unkeyed.
4. Age： defines the times in seconds the object has been in the proxy cache.
5: Server-Timing: cdn-cache; desc=HIT also indicates that a resource was cached

web cache poisoning：在request的header中修改或增加部分内容，该内容会出现在response中。利用Cache机制攻击者可把恶意内容注入到response中然后缓存，其他人访问该请求时会返回带有恶意内容的response。
